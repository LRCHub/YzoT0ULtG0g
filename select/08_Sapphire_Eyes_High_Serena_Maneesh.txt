Set away
From this body shaded pain
This deviled chain
Death choired rain
Your name prevail

Sober limbs
Dressed in anxious move and smile
In reach for you
They scream for you
Swaying on edge of lies and brokenness to you

You shining through
To through my vein through the veil of my shame
Where could i head back to my darkened way
Leave my fear on your floor, let my heart bleed no more
Bleed no more
